The following CSS code uses a pseudo-element selector (::before or ::after) that is not correctly combined with content property. This leads to no visible content being displayed even though the pseudo-element is technically applied.

```css
div::before {
  content: '';
  /* other styles */
}
```

The problem lies in using an empty string ('') for the content property.  While not causing a syntax error, it results in nothing being displayed. To fix it, you need to specify actual content, even if it's a non-breaking space to make sure the pseudo-element has a size.
