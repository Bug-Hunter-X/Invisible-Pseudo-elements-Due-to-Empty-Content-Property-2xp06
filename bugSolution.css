The solution involves replacing the empty string in the `content` property with a valid value. This makes the pseudo-element visible.

```css
div::before {
  content: " "; /* or \20; or "some text"; or url(image.png); */
  /* other styles */
}
```

Using `" "`, a non-breaking space, is often preferred for visual purposes when you don't need to display text or an image. This will give the pseudo-element a small amount of width and height allowing other styles to take effect.
